            This website was created as a final project for the
            <a target="blank" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/">Harvard's CS50x</a>,
            an introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and
            the art of programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            In it's Final Project page, the instructors make that request:
            "All that we ask is that you build something of interest to you,
            that you solve an actual problem, that you impact your community,
            or that you change the world. Strive to create something that outlives this course.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't know how to change the world. It's to big a task to anyone.
            In a world with almost 8 billion people, making any sort of impact is something
            that most of us will live and die without achieving. But I believe that anyone can,
            and should, make an impact to the people they care about. The people who are close to them.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to do that, I decided to challenge people to
            search for the unknown. To do things that they are not used to.
            To try to better understand others and learn and admire things
            outside they preferences, beyond what is popular. I'm sure that
            anyone who complete CHALLENGE50 will never forget that experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope to achieve more than just a certificate. I hope this idea
            outlives myself in your memories.

            My name is Fabiano. I was born in 1987 in Campinas, SÃ£o Paulo, Brasil.

        <p>
            I got a vocational degree in Electronics back in 2007. In july, 2020,
            I started studying code development. Besides CS50x, I'm studying at
            a local university for an associate degree, which I should get by the
            end of 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            My main hobby is reading. I also enjoy coding, obviously, designing
            electronics circuits, which is also obvious, and other things that
            are not so obvious: baseball (almost inexistent in Brasil) and football
            (american, not soccer).
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite being a brazilian, I hate soccer. But I like
